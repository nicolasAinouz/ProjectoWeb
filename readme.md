### Improvements:

- Store my API keys on a backend server.
- Use ChatGPT on the Discover a Streamer page to generate a biography for each streamer (Idea attempted but unavailable without a paid version of ChatGPT :/).
- Add more text
- Add/Improve errors message
- I did not integrate the use of a social media API because I don't have Instagram or Facebook, and the LinkedIn API doesn't truly allow subscribing to someone's feed. I hope that integrating the Twitch API will be sufficient for the API usage requirement.
